    "\n",
    "[Kullback-Liebler (KL) Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence), also known as relative entropy, is a statistical distance measurement of how one probability distribution, $Q$ a model, differs from a second distribution, $P$ the data. Note: while KL Divergence is a distance it is not a metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kullback–Leibler divergence is then interpreted as the average difference of the number of bits required for encoding samples of $P$ using a code optimized for $Q$ rather than one optimized for $P$. Once again, for more information check out this article from [machine learning mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/divergence-between-probability-distributions/) that this tutorial is based on.\n",

    "KL Divergence Follows the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{KL}(P || Q) = -\\sum_{x \\in X} P(x) * \\log (\\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is that the value within the sum, $P(x) * \\log (\\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)})$ is the divergence for the event x. The negative sum can be removed by simply reformatting the equation to the more common implementation:\n",

    "\\text{KL}(P || Q) = \\sum_{x \\in X} P(x) * \\log (\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for the KL divergence score is that when the probability for an event from P is large, but the probability for the same event in Q is small, there is a large divergence. When the probability from P is small and the probability from Q is large, there is also a large divergence, but not as large as the first case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT**: KL Divergence is not symmetrical, that is: $\\text{KL}(P || Q) != \\text{KL}(Q || P)$, hence why it cannot be considered a metric."
